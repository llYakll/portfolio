                <p>
                  Hello! My name is Zachary Sullivan and I greatly appreciate
                  you taking the time to review my portfolio.
                </p>
                     <br>
                     <h2>
                        Professional Life
                     </h2>
                     <br>
                <p>
                    I am currently a telecommunications contractor for 
                    Verizon Wireless, U.S. Cellular, AT&T, and am
                     responsible for the maintenance and 
                    upkeep of 36 Missouri county e-911 systems. 
                    I have done a little bit of everything communications related the in the past 10 years, 
                    from building the structure, mounting equipment,
                    or simply changing a light bulb! This industry has made me accustomed
                    to long work days and a harsh working environment which is why 
                    i'm seeking a change in my career path. As you can imagine, hanging equipment
                    at an elevation of several hundred feet in all varieties of weather conditions 
                    takes it's toll on the body. While I have been well compensated for my knowledge
                    and physical ability in this field, age has determined it's time to move in 
                    another direction.
